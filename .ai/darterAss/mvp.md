# App - Darter Assistant (MVP)

### Main goal
While there are applications that manage dart tournaments, none currently focus on personal performance tracking across multiple tournaments.
Darter Assistant aims to be the personal analytics and improvement platform for dart players — a place to store, analyze, and improve results over time.

### MVP - Minimum Viable Product
- Record results from all tournaments they participate in.
- View list of tournaments by logged user.
- Write personal goal (average between start and end date)
- Track progress toward personal goals (e.g., target average, win ratio, consistency).
- Basic account system (email + password).
- AI Integration (Motivational Assistant). Basic AI assistant that provides short, positive feedback messages or motivational insights after each tournament.
Example: “Your average improved by 4%! Keep aiming for 180s!”
Early personalization: adjusts feedback tone based on recent performance trends.

### Not included in MVP
- Real-time match data entry or live tournament integration.
- Social or data-sharing features.

- 75% of users create at least one personal improvement goal (e.g., “reach 70 average”).
- Positive feedback score ≥ 4.5/5 on app store reviews after launch.
