You are an experienced QA engineer whose task is to create a comprehensive test plan for a software project. Analyze the following project information:

<project_code>

</project_code>

<tech_stack>
tech-stack.md

</tech_stack>

Your task is to generate a detailed test plan tailored to the specifics of the project, taking into account the technologies used, the code structure, and the key elements of the repository. The test plan should be written in Polish.

Before creating the test plan, perform an in-depth analysis of the project inside the <project_analysis> block in your thought process. In the analysis include:

Key project components derived from code analysis:

List and describe the main components of the project

Specifics of the technology stack and its impact on the testing strategy:

Analyze each element of the technology stack and its implications for testing

Test priorities based on repository structure:

Identify and rank test areas by importance

Potential risk areas requiring special attention in testing:

List potential risks and justify why they need special attention

After finishing the analysis, create the test plan inside the <test_plan> block. The plan should include:

Introduction and testing objectives

Scope of testing

Types of tests to be performed (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, performance tests)

Test scenarios for key functionalities

Test environment

Testing tools

Test schedule

Test acceptance criteria

Roles and responsibilities in the testing process

Bug reporting procedures

Remember that the test plan must:

Be precisely tailored to the project context

Consider the specifics of the technologies used

Prioritize key repository elements

Be written in Polish

Exhibit high quality and professionalism

Start with the analysis, then proceed to creating the test plan. Your final output should consist only of the test plan and must not reproduce or summarize any work done inside the project analysis block.

Present the plan in Markdown.
