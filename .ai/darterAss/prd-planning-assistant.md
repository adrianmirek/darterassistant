# App - Darter Assistant (MVP)

### Main goal
While there are applications that manage dart tournaments, none currently focus on personal performance tracking across multiple tournaments.
Darter Assistant aims to be the personal analytics and improvement platform for dart players — a place to store, analyze, and improve results over time.

### MVP - Minimum Viable Product
- Record results from all tournaments they participate in.
- View list of tournaments by logged user.
- Write personal goal (average between start and end date)
- Track progress toward personal goals (e.g., target average, win ratio, consistency).
- Basic account system (email + password).
- AI Integration (Motivational Assistant). Basic AI assistant that provides short, positive feedback messages or motivational insights after each tournament.
Example: “Your average improved by 4%! Keep aiming for 180s!”
Early personalization: adjusts feedback tone based on recent performance trends.

### Not included in MVP
- Real-time match data entry or live tournament integration.
- Social or data-sharing features.
- Integration with official tournament management apps.
- Advanced analytics (e.g., heatmaps, shot accuracy).
- Training plan generator.
- View detailed performance statistics by tournament and over time.

### Success Criteria
- 90% of users use the app regularly (at least 2 tournaments saved per month).
- 75% of users create at least one personal improvement goal (e.g., “reach 70 average”).
- Positive feedback score ≥ 4.5/5 on app store reviews after launch.

Analyze the information provided, focusing on aspects relevant to PRD creation. Consider the following questions:
<prd_analysis>
1. Identify the main problem that the product is intended to solve.
2. Define the key functionalities of the MVP.
3. Consider potential user stories and paths of product usage.
4. Think about success criteria and how to measure them.
5. Assess design constraints and their impact on product development.
</prd_analysis>

Based on your analysis, generate a list of 10 questions and recommendations in a combined form (question + recommendation). These should address any ambiguities, potential issues, or areas where more information is needed to create an effective PRD. Consider questions about:

1. Details of the user's problem
2. Prioritization of functionality
3. Expected user experience
4. Measurable success indicators
5. Potential risks and challenges
6. Schedule and resources

<questions>
List your questions and recommendations here, numbered for clarity:

For example:
1. Are you planning to introduce paid subscriptions from the start of the project?

Recommendation: The first phase of the project could focus on free features to attract users, and paid features could be introduced at a later stage.
</questions>

Continue this process, generating new questions and recommendations based on the user's responses, until the user explicitly asks for a summary.

Remember to focus on clarity, relevance, and accuracy of results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.

Analytical work should be done in the thinking block. The final output should consist solely of questions and recommendations and should not duplicate or repeat any work done in the prd_analysis section.
