1. Use a simple email + password sign-up and login flow with “forgot password” (no email confirmation).  
2. Backend technology: .NET Core API with SQL Server and Entity Framework ORM.  
3. No onboarding/tutorial in MVP.  
4. Stats entry form presented as a single, scrollable page.  
5. In MVP users can only add tournament entries—no edit or delete functionality.  
6. Field-level validation required, with detailed rules to be defined later.  
7. No visualization progress with a line chart for average over time and a progress bar for goal completion - not in MVP.  
8. AI motivational feedback triggered on demand via a “Get Feedback” button, displayed as a toast.  
9. Frontend technology: Astro + React.  
10. 4-week timeline broken into 1-week sprints.

<matched_recommendations>
1. Implement email + password flow with “forgot password” and defer social login.  
2. Define and implement field-level validations (min/max checks) before submission.  
3. Start with a single, scrollable form for stats entry to minimize complexity.    
5. Add a “Get Feedback” button and simple toast component for AI motivational messages.  
6. Prototype the simplest data-entry flow first and plan additional import options later.

The team will build a web-only MVP for “Darter Assistant” to track personal performance across tournaments. Core features include user authentication via email + password with “forgot password,” and a single-page form to record tournament stats (place, date, match type, result, AVG, first-9 AVG, CheckOut %, counts of 60+ through 180, high finish, best leg, worst leg). Users can view their list of saved tournaments and set personal average-based goals. An on-demand “Get Feedback” button triggers brief AI-powered motivational toasts.

Key user stories:
- As a player, I can sign up, log in, and recover my password.
- As a player, I can add tournament results in a single form.
- As a player, I can view my tournament history.
- As a player, I can set and track an average-based improvement goal.
- As a player, I can request motivational feedback after saving a tournament.

Success criteria:
- 90% of users save at least two tournaments per month (tracked via backend events).  
- 75% of users create at least one personal improvement goal (tracked via goal-creation events).  
- Positive user feedback (≥4.5/5) measured via app reviews or in-app surveys.
