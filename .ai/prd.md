# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Darter Assistant

## 1. Product Overview
Darter Assistant is a web-based analytics and improvement platform for amateur and professional darts players. It enables users to record and review personal performance across multiple tournaments, set improvement goals, and receive AI-powered motivational feedback to foster continuous development.

## 2. User Problem
Many darts players participate in multiple tournaments but lack a centralized tool to track their performance trends over time. Existing applications focus on tournament management or live scoring, not on personal analytics and goal tracking. Players need a simple way to log results, view progress, and stay motivated between events.
